CSES - Inversion Probability



Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



An array has $n$ integers $x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n$, and each of them has been randomly chosen between $1$ and $r\_i$. An inversion is a pair $(a,b)$ where $ax\_b$.


What is the expected number of inversions in the array?

Input


The first input line contains an integer $n$: the size of the array.


The second line contains $n$ integers $r\_1,r\_2,\dots,r\_n$: the range of possible values for each array position.

Output


Print the expected number of inversions rounded to six decimal places (rounding half to even).

Constraints

$1 \le n \le 100$
$1 \le r\_i \le 100$
