CSES - Inverse Inversions



Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Your task is to create a permutation of numbers $1,2,\dots,n$ that has exactly $k$ inversions.


An inversion is a pair $(a,b)$ where $ap\_b$ where $p\_i$ denotes the number at position $i$ in the permutation.

Input


The only input line has two integers $n$ and $k$.

Output


Print a line that contains the permutation. You can print any valid solution.

Constraints

 $1 \le n \le 10^6$
 $0 \le k \le \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$

Example


Input:
5 4


Output:
1 5 2 4 3
