Given an $n \times m$ grid and two squares $a=(y\_1,x\_1)$ and $b=(y\_2,x\_2)$, create a path from $a$ to $b$ that visits each square exactly once.

For example, here is a path from $a=(1,3)$ to $b=(3,6)$ in a $4 \times 7$ grid:

Input

The first input line has an integer $t$: the number of tests.

After this, there are $t$ lines that describe the tests. Each line has six integers $n$, $m$, $y\_1$, $x\_1$, $y\_2$ and $x\_2$.

In all tests $1 \le y\_1,y\_2 \le n$ and $1 \le x\_1,x\_2 \le m$. In addition, $y\_1 \neq y\_2$ or $x\_1 \neq x\_2$.

Output

Print YES, if it is possible to construct a path, and NO otherwise.

If there is a path, also print its description which consists of characters U (up), D (down), L (left) and R (right). If there are several paths, you can print any of them.

Constraints

$1 \le t \le 100$
$1 \le n \le 50$
$1 \le m \le 50$
