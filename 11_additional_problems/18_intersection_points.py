Given $n$ horizontal and vertical line segments, your task is to calculate the number of their intersection points.

You can assume that no parallel line segments intersect, and no endpoint of a line segment is an intersection point.

Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the number of line segments.

Then there are $n$ lines describing the line segments. Each line has four integers: $x\_1$, $y\_1$, $x\_2$ and $y\_2$: a line segment begins at point $(x\_1,y\_1)$ and ends at point $(x\_2,y\_2)$.

Output

Print the number of intersection points.

Constraints

$1 \le n \le 10^5$
$-10^6 \le x\_1 \le x\_2 \le 10^6$
$-10^6 \le y\_1 \le y\_2 \le 10^6$
$(x\_1,y\_1) \neq (x\_2,y\_2)$

Example

3
2 3 7 3
3 1 3 5
6 2 6 6

Output:
