The first input line has an integer $n$: the initial size of the list. During the process, the elements are numbered $1,2,\dots,k$ where $k$ is the current size of the list.


The second line has $n$ integers $x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n$: the contents of the list.


The last line has $n$ integers $p\_1,p\_2,\dots,p\_n$: the positions of the elements to be removed.

Output


Print the elements in the order they are removed.

Constraints

$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
$1 \le x\_i \le 10^9$
$1 \le p\_i \le n-i+1$

Example


Input:
5

2 6 1 4 2

3 1 3 1 1


Output:
1 2 2 6 4


Explanation: The contents of the list are $[2,6,1,4,2]$, $[2,6,4,2]$, $[6,4,2]$, $[6,4]$, $[4]$ and $[]$.
