CSES - Polygon Area



Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Your task is to calculate the area of a given polygon.


The polygon consists of $n$ vertices $(x\_1,y\_1),(x\_2,y\_2),\dots,(x\_n,y\_n)$. The vertices $(x\_i,y\_i)$ and $(x\_{i+1},y\_{i+1})$ are adjacent for $i=1,2,\dots,n-1$, and the vertices $(x\_1,y\_1)$ and $(x\_n,y\_n)$ are also adjacent.

Input


The first input line has an integer $n$: the number of vertices.


After this, there are $n$ lines that describe the vertices. The $i$th such line has two integers $x\_i$ and $y\_i$.


You may assume that the polygon is simple, i.e., it does not intersect itself.

Output


Print one integer: $2a$ where the area of the polygon is $a$ (this ensures that the result is an integer).

Constraints

$3 \le n \le 1000$
$-10^9 \le x\_i, y\_i \le 10^9$
